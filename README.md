This repo exists so I could have a free website available to the public.
Currently it is housing my e-portfolio, but as I'm limited to one website that is subject to change at my discretion.
My e-portfolio exists for my candidacy to the IT-sector.
You can take a look at the website at PastelBun.github.io
